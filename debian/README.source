khronos-opencl-headers for Debian
---------------------------------

The headers can be downloaded as individual files from
<https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/>.  The 'tarball' target in
debian/rules can be used to generate a tarball from the upstream git
repository https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Headers.git
(needs to be avalable as a remote). The MAJOR, MINOR and COMMIT
environment variables must be set to select the API version and
the commit to be packaged.
